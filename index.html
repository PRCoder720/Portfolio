        <p>

            In my free time, I enjoy volunteering with local charities, giving back to the community through meaningful projects.
             As a passionate snowboarder, I love hitting the slopes in the Rockies and sharing that passion with others. 
             I volunteer with the Burton Chill Program, where I teach underprivileged kids how to snowboard, helping them build confidence and discover the joy of the sport.<br><br>
              I’m also passionate about traveling, exploring new cultures, and learning from every destination I visit.
               Recently, I’ve had the opportunity to explore Japan, Canada, Mexico, and Italy, as well as frequent visits to New York and California. 
               These experiences broaden my perspective and spark fresh ideas for my work. 
               They play a big role in shaping my creative process, inspiring me to craft digital solutions that are as unique and dynamic as the places I’ve explored. 
            </p>
